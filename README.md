# Leave Management System
## Introduction
This is a simple leave management system that allows users to apply for leave and view their leave history. The system also allows the admin to view all leave applications and approve or reject them.
This system has dynamic approval levels. This means that the admin can set the approval levels for each leave type. For example, the admin can set the approval level for annual leave to be 2. This means that the leave application will be approved by the admin and the manager. The admin can also set the approval level for medical leave to be 1. This means that the leave application will only be approved by the admin.
